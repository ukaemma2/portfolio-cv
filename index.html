                        <h5>SOFTWARE</h5>
                        Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated 
                        by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. Invited to join my friend's start-up 
                        company as a front-end developer, I gained experience of working in this area. As this area complements 
                        my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing 
                        to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and 
                        friendly addition to your team. I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.
